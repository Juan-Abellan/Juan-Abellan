<h1>Hi, I'm Juan!

<a href="https://github.com/Juan-Abellan">programmer / data analyst</a></h1>

Since my Master‚Äôs degree I have worked as an architect in Spain, Ireland and Germany. Thus, I was able to gain experience in offices of different nations and content orientations.
In order to develop professionally, I decided to acquire skills in programming and data science. Since June 2022 I completed an online course in Python programming. After that I participated in the LeWagon Data Science Bootcamp in Berlin, where I was able to deepen topics such as data analysis, machine learning, and programming. At this moment I am developing my portfolio in programming and data analysis. At the same time I am looking for my first job as a junior data analyst. My goal is to start working and continue learning in a corporate environment.
